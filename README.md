# O.S-assignment 2019089034 소프트웨어학부 김현진

My name is Kim Hyun Jin. I live in South Korea. Also, I am a sophomore in Hanyang University ERICA. I made this repository for the lecture assignment. The lecture name is 'Open Source Development'. I belong to a team that name is ‘Growing'. I named my team this way because I will grow up doing this task. I have two classmate members on my team. We are going to make a  program.
