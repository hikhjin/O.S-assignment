# O.S-assignment

My name is Kim Hyun Jin. I live in South Korea. Also, I am a sophomore in Hanyang University ERICA. I made this repository for the lecture assignment. The lecture name is <Open Source Development>. I belong to a team that name is ‘Growing’. My team members are in one class. We are going to make a program.
